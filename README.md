# Python Course Homework - Basics & OOP 📘🐍

## Introduction
This repository contains homework assignments for a Python course covering fundamental programming concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The assignments are divided into two main sections: **Python Basics** and **OOP**.

## Contents

### 1. Python Basics 🏗️
The basics section covers essential programming concepts in Python. Each topic is designed to help you understand and practice Python syntax and logic.

- **Variables** 🏷️: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
- **Operators** ➕➖✖️➗: Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.
- **Printing** 🖨️: Using `print()` for output.
- **Selection** 🔀: Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- **For Loop** 🔄: Iterating over sequences.
- **While Loop** 🔁: Looping with conditions.
- **Functions** 🔣: Defining and using functions.
- **More Functions** 🛠️: Advanced function concepts, such as lambda functions and function arguments.
- **Recursion** 🔃: Understanding recursive functions.
- **List** 📜: Working with lists and list operations.
- **Nested List** 📂: Handling lists within lists.
- **Dictionary & Set** 📖: Key-value pairs and unordered collections.
- **Files** 📁: Reading and writing files.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏛️
The OOP section introduces the principles of object-oriented programming to develop modular and reusable code.

- **Class** 🎭: Defining and using classes.
- **Inheritance** 🏗️: Extending classes to create new ones.
- **Polymorphism** 🔄: Implementing method overriding and function overloading.

## How to Use 🚀
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
